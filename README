About mirthCasts
================
mirthCasts is about two things for me, Mirth evangelism and professional development. I have been a an avid fan and user of this software product since its sub 1.0 days, and still feel the value add has yet to be recognized in various sectors. I love to teach. I have taught and spoke at several health care conferences and educational venues, and taken on to screencasting as my favorite delivery method, and also my favorite learning tool for myself. mirthCasts is my effort at providing an educational service to wrap up these interests.
